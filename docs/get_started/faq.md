## FAQ

### How to integrate with gitlab?

> You can simply add new source of gitlab in `run.conf`.

### Why we need run --init?

> We have to initialize directories and configuration file after downloading the binary `run`.

### Support private repository or not?

> Nope. Currently we can only download scripts from public repositories.

### Support Windows or not?

> Nope. Most scrips are not compatible in Windows, so `run` doesn't support it now.
